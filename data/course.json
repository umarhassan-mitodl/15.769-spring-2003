Supply chain design and 3-D concurrent engineering literature as developed in Charles Fine\u2019s book, _Clockspeed: Winning Industry Control in the Age of Temporary Advantage._ Perseus Books, 1999.\n\nThe concepts there emphasize the necessity of integrating product strategy, manufacturing strategy, and supply chain strategy.\u00a0As a result, each of these will be touched upon in the course.\n",
